Code for a challenge for a statistics course - July 2024

Description of the challenge:

These data relate to the results of students in secondary education (high school) in two Portuguese schools. The characteristics measured are students' grades in the Portuguese language, and their demographic, social and academic characteristics. These characteristics were collected using school reports and questionnaires ([1] P. Cortez and A. Silva, “Using data mining to predict secondary school student performance”. Proceedings of 5th Annual Future Business Technology Conference, 2008.)

For the challenge, we have a set of 649 individuals (students). The task is to predict the grade obtained in the third and final year of secondary school. It is therefore a regression problem.
After an exploratory analysis of the data, you will have to predict the grade obtained by the students on the basis of a test data set.
