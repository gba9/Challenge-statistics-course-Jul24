Code for a challenge for a statistics course - July 2024

Description of the challenge:

These data relate to the results of students in secondary education (high school) in two Portuguese schools. The characteristics measured are students' grades in the Portuguese language, and their demographic, social and academic characteristics. These characteristics were collected using school reports and questionnaires ([1] P. Cortez and A. Silva, “Using data mining to predict secondary school student performance”. Proceedings of 5th Annual Future Business Technology Conference, 2008.)

For the challenge, we have a set of 649 individuals (students). The task is to predict the grade obtained in the third and final year of secondary school. It is therefore a regression problem.
After an exploratory analysis of the data, you will have to predict the grade obtained by the students on the basis of a test data set.

My analysis was not comprehensive (far from it!) and thus the prediction models tested might not be the best, but the goal was more to test a range of different models and compare them. Even though the choices made in accounting for the missing data and in the models hyperparameters was far from being perfect, a good prediction score was achieved compare to my classmates...
